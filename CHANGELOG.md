BREAKING CHANGE:  Images have been pulled out of the Image Cycle action, and will be added to the images for the Tile itself.  This will give greater flexibility into changing the Tiles images, but will deprecate the Image Cycle action, and the Set Image Cycle action.  They're changing to Switch Tile Image.  Active Tiles should convert your Tiles the first time it loads, but will leave the Image Cycle action, in case you wanted to retain the iformation.  The action will not produce any effect though, and is safe to leave in the list.  Or can be removed in order to clean up the information.

Fixed an issue that multiline text areas weren't being registered correctly and it was defaulting back to a text box

Defaulting to allow player to use the action while a GM isn't available.

Defaulting the Tiles to be active when created.

Added the option to not record the Tiles history.  It can get pretty large at times and if it's not cleaned out regularily could cause performance issues.  Especially for menu type displays.  If it's not needed then you can remove it.

Added the option to allow turn on the pointer cursor whenever you hover over the Tile.  So if you're using the Tile like a button, this will give feedback to the user that it's clickable.

Still fixing the issue teleporting to other scenes.

## Version 1.0.57

Fixing issue with teleporting to other scenes.

## Version 1.0.56

Added a flag for teleporting so the token won't be moved mid-teleport.  I believe this was causing a sync issue between the GM and players.

Added more verbose debug statements that can be truned on when debugging.

Added a `Hover` trigger that will combine both Hover In and Hover Out.

Fixed the `Enter/Exit` trigger so that it returns which of the two actually got triggered, so the history will show Enter or Exit properly.

Made sure that the cool down period for key presses only affects the actual Stop Movement action.

Added the wait spinner cursor tot he canvas when a cooldown period has been activated so that the player knows something is happening and Foundry isn't just eating key presses.

Fixed an issue adding information tot he history.

Added a macro to help with redirecting On Enter and On Exit triggers.  So with a Macro and soem Anchors you can have an On Enter action and an On Exit action happen for the same Tile.  No need to overlay two Tiles over top of each other for the same effect.

Added option to change the colour used for the screen wash when teleporting a token, as well as the option to turn it off.

## Version 1.0.55

Allow roll tables use tables in compendiums.

Fixed some really messed up code when rolling from the roll table.

Fixed issues with sending token data to tiles triggered by other tiles.

Changed the Stop if doesn't exist filter to now check for a count of entities.  Before it was set to > 0, now you can have it check to see if the are more than 3 tokens.  You can also now check other collections.  So you can check the count of tiles, or walls, or items that are currently being tracked, and not just tokens.

Added a filter Tile triggered, that will now check the number of times the Tile has been triggered.  So you can stop remaining actions depending on how many times the tile has been triggered.  And with the addition of this filter, the Min. Required field has been removed.  Since this filter essentially takes its place, with greater flexibility.  As with other changes, if your Tile already uses this feature it will still function, and remain on the Tile sheet, but for any furture Tiles, or ones that never had that set, the field won't appear and you'll need to switch to using the filter.

Added a filter Token triggered, that will check the number of times a token has triggered the Tile.  So you can now have the trap only trigger the thrird time a token enters the area.

Updated the attribute filter to be able to check on attributes from other collections than just tokens.

Added the option to add `and` and `or` when using the attribute filter.

Fixed issues with getting entities from within the Tile if the GM is not on the same scene as the players.

Fixed an issue with alter that it wouldn't alter the Actor data even though it would find the actor information.

Updated the audio settings so you can play the audio clip for the triggering player, or for the player that owns the Token.  So the GM can trigger sounds for the players now.

And cleared up the text description so it makes mroe sense what the setting is refering to.

Clamped the volume settings so that it can't exceed 1.

Fixed an issue in PF2E where clicking on a Tile was broken.

Fixed an issue with passing the action id properly.

Fixed the Multiple Anchors based on DC macro.

Added the option to cycle through images randomly.

Fixed an issue with how other modules can add their actions to Monks Active Tiles.  To avoid duplication of action names.  This will require all Tiles within your world be adjusted... but it should be handled automatically by Active Tiles.

## Version 1.0.50

Added the option when changing Door state to change from regular to secret door.

Added two new When options, On Combat Round start, and On Combat Turn start

Allow movement for Ambient Light and Ambient Sound.  Although it's a little weird and won't actually update until it reaches its destination.

Added the option to go to an achor if the Check if tokens exist filter returns no actors.

Fixed an issue where resetting the history was clearing out changes made due to a refresh of the Dialog.

Fixed an issue where items dropped from a Compendium onto the map were causing errors.

## Version 1.0.48

## Version 1.0.44

Added the feature of changing the sidebar tab or canvas tool to match the default entity type needed for the select entity field.  And changing it back once done selecting.

Updated the function that grabs the entity name so that it's dynamic rather than relying on the last value collected whent he entity was selected.

Added the feature of selecting the current canvas position

Added Tagger support so you can now refer to entities by their tag.

Added Cycle image list action, you can select individual files or use wildcards

Added checking for required fields

Added conditional fields that will show/hide depending on what's been selected in other fields.

Fixed an issue with action re-ordering

Fixed an issue with action deleting

Added the feature of default values when creating brand new actions

Tidied up some styling, gave the actions more room and standardised the button sizes.

Added syntax highlighting and reviewed all the action names to make sure what was happening was a bit clearer.

Added a new macro so people can do multiple actions depending on the value of a request roll rather than just pass and fail.

Standardized how the location is retrieved.

Added scaling for panning the canvas

Added option to preserve setting when teleporting a token to a new scene.  Just in case you have tokens already set up on that scene and want to use the properties already set up.

Added the option to use the alter action value with an `=` so Active Tiles will try and evaluate whatever is in that field.

Updated the stop sound action to work on multiple Tiles.

Updated the change door state to work with multiple Walls.

Fixed issue with languages drop down not showing

Added option to open a Journal Entry using Enhanced Journals if it's installed

Updated the distance check to respect a Tiles rotation, and give you more flexibility it what you want in terms of distance.  So you can have within the Tile, within a certain distance formt he Tile, and greater than a certain distance from the Tile.  It will now also respect the edge of the Tile rather than working off the center, so if you have an odd shaped Tile it will check from the closest edge.  Also added a dropdow so you can select distinct pixels or use the scenes grid size.

Added the option to have anchors stop the current flow of actions.  This should trim down the need for a whole bunch of Stop actions.

Fixed up issue with rotated Tiles

## Version 1.0.43

Fixed an issue with attacks not rolling correctly.  v9 changed rolls to being async and I forgot that I did use that function.

## Version 1.0.42

Fixed issue with not being able to create new actions

Started to add fixes for actions that can't be run without a GM.

Integrated with Enhanced Journal a little better.

Hopefully fixed an issue with PF1 and attacks

## Version 1.0.40

Fixing an error with creating a new Tile.

Fixing issues missed with v9 changes.

## Version 1.0.39

Updates to support v9

Fixed an issue with the delay action if it's a proper number rather than a strings

Fixed an issue with checking if a Tile can be triggered.  Some of the new triggers were firing even when they shouldn't have been.

Fixed an issue with how the history was being saved

## Version 1.0.38

Added context menu to action list so you can now clone an action.

Fixed an issue when altering a flags property.  A previous fix was set to ignore anything that was null, but flags are commonly undefined.

Added the option to limit the number of loops the jump to anchor will take, and added the option to end after the loop is done, or resume the remaining actions.

Fixed an issue on hover if the Tile has no trigger data

Added the point that triggered the Tile to the values being sent.  So Macros now know a bit more about where ont he Tile the click happened.

Moved the click function to it's own code attached to the Tile.  This will let other modules send a click even directly to a Tile.

## Version 1.0.37

Fixed an issue with re-ordering a newly created action.

Added option to add action controls as numbers and not just text

Changed how delay works now.  I wasn't able to do it previously but now that Active Tiles can save a state and resume later, I've changed the delay to it's own action.  This means that actions needing to be delayed will stay in the action list.  Previously they'd be put in their own loop to complete and caused some strange issues.  It should not affect current actions that have delay set.  The control for delay will still show up for the old action but won't be available for newly created actions.

This also gives some greater flexibility with how long you delay.  Using `1-5` will delay randomly between 1 to 5 seconds.  And using `1,4,8,12` will randomly pick between 1, 4, 8, or 12 seconds.  And they can be used together.

Added Triggering Tile to the Move action.  You could always select it as the entity to use, but now there's a convenient button to click to select it.

Added error checking to make sure an audiofile exists before trying to play it.

Updated the Attack option to select either a Token or an Actor.  Previously you needed to select an Actor, but that was causing confusion.  If you select a Token instead it will then find the related Actor.

Added option to start a combat after adding tokens to it.

Added the option to call macros with extra data.  The core macro call wasn't sending everything that would be needed.  I was relying on Advanced Macros to provide the extra data, but if Advanced Macros aren't available I added code to handle it the same way.

Added correct code fo Hover In and Hover Out.  I can't remember who provided the code as it's been awhile, but thank you!  I appreciate it.

Added two new ways to trigger, On Stop when the token stops within the Tile, and On Double Click, same as click but more of it.

Fixed issues with players calling Active TIles when the GM is away.

Fixing an issue with clearing the save state.

Fixed an issue where altering a null value was failing

Added a filter to make sure that tokens exist.  This is because requesting a roll will default to the current party if no tokens are selecting.  This could cause issues.

## Version 1.0.36

Added option to play playlist track.

Added option to run chat commands using the chat action

Fixed issue with how chat messages are sent, and who is shown to have sent them.

Added option to reset history after a delay, so there can be a cooldown period.

Revamped the run macro action so that running as GM or Player is now an option from Active Tiles and doesn't need additional modules.

Macros run by players can now return results to the GM and stay in sync with the remaining actions.

Added Hook so that other modules can add options to the actions list.

Added support for Levels 3D so that tokens can be clicked while using that module.

Corrected French tanslations, thank you Sasmira

Fixed issues with rotated Tiles not activating correctly.

Added the option to pause remaining actions while an action completes.  This means that Tokenbar requests can now be rolled by players... provided Tokenbar is updated.

## Version 1.0.35

Added chat buttle checkbox for Chat Messages, just in case you don't want the chat bubble to appear.

Change the functionality of the in character checkbox to better match what Foundry uses.  I think it was using the players name too soon.

Fixed an issue with Manually Triggering the tile.

## Version 1.0.34

There is now a filter to remove Tokens that aren't within a specific distance to the Tile.

There is some rudimentary logic now, you can set anchor points, jumpt to those anchor points, or stop any remaining actions.

You can now pause or unpause the game using an action

You can now activate Difficult Terrain from the Enhanced Terrain Layer

Changed the tile trigger action so that it can now trigger the original tile.  This was originally put in place to stop infinte loops... but with it removed you can now do repetative tasks.

It will now stop any remaining tasks if the Tile is deactivated and it was in the middle of processing tasks.

Added the method that the tile was triggered to the information sent to a macro.

Manually triggering a Tile will now select the currently controlled tokens.  So when a Tile is set to maually trigger and another Tile triggers it, you can use tokens.

## Version 1.0.31

Changed the Action config so that the autofill for Tokens will populate with token attributes and Tiles will populate with tile attributes.

Added HoverIn and HoverOut as ways to trigger a Tile.  Unfortunately it only works if the Tile layer is active.  Working on providing it for the Token layer aswell.

Added french translation

Added macro packs with a Macro to set all Active Tiles to active.

Added option to select what tokens are teleported rather than just relying on the triggering token.

Fixed up teleport so that if the the player is on a different scene than the GM the token can still be moved.

Added integration with Better Tables

Added option to check permissions for opening Journal Entries.

Added option to activate the scene when switching scenes.

BREAKING CHANGE
Changed to using continue as the value to alter if yuo want actions to continue.  This will unfortunately have an effect on any Macros that currently return {result: false}, this will need to be changed to {continue:false}

I've also updated the way that tokens are passed between actions.  It will start with the triggering Tokens, but the currently viewed Tokens can be changed.  So if you request a saving roll, you can now set the current tokens to be the ones that passed or failed, and then further actions can switch the current tokens back to the triggering tokens.  What this means is you can now have a trap, that takes the tokens that failed and apply an active effect to them, then teleport all the tokens to a new location if any of them failed.

## Version 1.0.30

Fixed issue with the tile history saving.

Added option to open journal entry just for the GM.

## Version 1.0.29

Added option to use the previous value for Activate.  So if module returns {activate: Boolean} you can use that value for Activate/Deactivate.

Fixed an issue with sound effects stopping.  Instead of using the requested entity, it was just using the Tile.

Fixed an issue with Chat Message where it was failing if there were no system languages.

Changed "Open Journal Entry" to "Open Entity Sheet" to allow the option to open up both Journal Entries and Actor sheets.

Fixed an issue with lighting effects that would disappear when walking over a Tile.  It's a bit of a patch though as I think there's an issue with Foundry code.

## Version 1.0.28

Fixed issue with getHistory not returning to correct countTriggered

Fixed issue with resetHistory when deleting token history when multiple tokens have history.

## Version 1.0.27

Added option for triggering with a minimum number of tokens.  So if you want the entire party to walk across a Tile before it triggers you can now do that.

Per Token has now changed to keeping a history of all the triggereing events that have happened to the Tile.  That way I can, in the future, improve upon what conditions trigger the Tile.

In line with changing from Per Token information to keeping a history, I've change the interface to using hasTriggered(tokenid, method, userid), countTriggered(), addHistory(tokenid, method, userid), removeHistory(id), and getHistory(tokenid)

Added the Hurt/Heal action to make it easier to alter HP while still respecting temporary hitpoints

Added the Reset Trigger History action, so you can reset the triggering history of a Tile.

Updated the stop sound action so that it can stop playing all ambient sounds and not just the Tile sounds.

Removed libRuler patching, since the module has now been patched with updates.  Thank you very much caewok!

## Version 1.0.26

Allow sound files to use wildcard when selecting.  So the Play Sound action can be randomized.

Added entity and current values to the Alter action.  Entity could be different than the triggering token, and current value will let you alter something based on the returned results of a previous action.

Added looping the the play sound action

Added Stop sound action, so you can now stop the looping sound of a Tile.

Added current values to the notification handlebars context, so you can use returned results in notifications.

Added the same to the chat message, and also added the current entity which might differ from the triggering token.

Fixed issue with polyglot language not being set.

Added option to only animate a Tile for the triggering player, instead of for everyone.

Fixed issue with setting permissions.  And prevented the canvas from panning to a random token.

Fixed issue where once per token was not being set by the On Click action.

Fixed issue where actions that were delayed by some time weren't firing.

Added API to support macros adding, checking, and reseting the once per token data.

Added elevation action, which is pretty much just a shorthand for alter.

## Version 1.0.25

Changes the way the trigger functions are called.  This isn't really visible to the players/GM but should make it easier behind the scenes to pass variables.

Added option to Pan Canvas to choose who the canvas pans for.

Fixed an issue with Canvas pan that was preventing the panning from being animated.

Added option of "From Previous" for Create Token, and Add Item actions.  What this will allow, is if a Roll Table is immediately above the Create or Add Item action, it will take the values from the Roll Table and use them.  So you can automatically create a monster from a rolltable, or automatically add an item from a Roll Table.

Activate can now be passed multiple entities.

On Click will now use the currently controlled Tokens.

Macros will get passed all the results from previous actions in the values property.  Accessed via arguments[0].values.

Added option to set the volume ofa Play Sound action.  If you want to set it to a specific volume, use a floating point number for percentage.  If you want to set ti as a percentage of the Core Ambient volume, use actual percent.  So 0.5 will set it to 50% volume.  And 50% will set it to 50% of the Foundry Ambient volume.

Updated the Chat Message so that it will use the correct TOken.  And can even be used to specify what Token does the Chat Message.  Along with allowing in character chat bubbles.

Fixing the Chat Message resulting from a Roll Table roll.  Before it was always from the GM, now if a Player activates it, it will show as coming from the player.

Updated the permissions action so that setting the permissions for everyone will set the default permission.

Repositioned the set target code in the attack action so that target are added before the attack happens.

## Version 1.0.24

Add option for teleport to delete the source Token instead of just making it invisible.

Allow both Tiles and Drawing to be moved.

Allow Drawings to be shown/hidden.

Update the attack action for PF2 and PF1

Add option to roll the attack instead of just displaying the chat card of the attack.

Added an action, You can now change the scene for a player.

Added another action, Add to combat, so you can add tokens to a combat.

BREAKING CHANGE, Updated the macro execution, thank you tposney, so that it should handle arguments the same way that Trigger Happy does.

Removed some debug information that was constantly being added.

## Version 1.0.23

Added a new action, trigger another Tile.  So now one Tile can trigger a different one

Added spells to the Attack action.

Added roll mode option tot he Attack action.

## Version 1.0.22

Fixed issue with the action config if there aren't any actors added to the world yet.

Added info if there's no token to teleport when a teleport action is triggered.

Allow Move Token action to move to a Tile and not just a location.

Removed the try catch blocks from individual actions and put it up one level, so that if any actions have an error it can be reported.

Creating a token can now use a Tile instead of just a location as a destination for the Token.

Added Attack action.  You'll need to set up an actor with the attack you wish to use but this can be used to calculate the damage of a trap.

Changed how macros are executed.  Before I was passing it back to the player to run the full macro, changed the code so the player runs a previously calculated version.  Means I don't have to recalculate arguments and hopefully I've fixed a bug where the macro won't run.

Fixed up issues with stopping the Token from moving.  Make it integrate with libRuler a little better and not require as many saves to the database.

Added cool down period for movement so if the player spams the movement key, and the Tile requests a stop, that it will briefly halt the movement of that Token even if more movement keys are pressed.

Added option to restrict a sound to a scene.  So only the players viewing the scene will hear it, GM's will still hear the sound though so they know what's happening.

## Version 1.0.21

Added typeahead to the Alter action Attribute field to make it a bit easier to know what goes there.

Fixed an issue with Handle bar support if the Tile is manually Clicked and there's no Token to add to the context properly.

Fixed issue when creating a chat message with no Token present.  It didn't know who to whisper to.

Added Permissions action. So you can now change the permissions of an entity when a Tile is triggered.

Fixed an issue with On Click and who's allowed to control the triggering.  It will now only trigger for the role that's been selected.

possibly BREAKING CHANGE, I had mis-labelled the variable name for who gets to control the trigger.  It's fixed now, but if you had a Tile that you set Controlled By, you'll need to change it back.  On the plus side, it should respect that now, whereas it wasn't working at all for previous versions.

Fixed an issue with a player manually triggering a Tile.

## Version 1.0.20

Removing debug information

Fixing small issue when a player tries to trigger a Tile.

## Version 1.0.19

Fixed issue when changing action, it would retain information for the previous action, and some of that data was incompatible with the next action.

Fixed issue where updating the action, wasn't using localization for the name.

Fixed issue where the delayed seconds weren't showing up on the action list.

Added the much asked for "On Click" trigger, so if you're on the token layer and the tile is set to On Click, it will trigger when clicked.

Updated the Action Config screen to use decimal seconds

Fixed issue where the display for 'pan canvas' was displaying snap information rather than location information.

Teleport will now let you avoid other tokens at the destination.  It will do its best to find the closest available spot to the destination, but it can get a little weird if transporting to a different scene.

Teleport should center your screen so the token is still under your mouse... but when switching to a different scene I can't figure out how to calculate it properly.

Increased the fade time when switching to a new scene so that it has time to load the scene in the background.

Fixed an issue where a teleported token was no longer the token being referenced in further actions because it was essentially a new token.  Updated the code so it will reference the new token from that point on.

Creating a token action will now also use a Tile for a drop location.  And you can set the token to be created as invisible.

Alter will now accept dice rolls using the [[1d4]] notation, and can be rolled to a chat message, and have the roll mode set properly.

Fixed an error in the code with Alter action and parcing it as a float properly.

Updated the Play Sound action to allow for sound to be played for everyone, gm only, and triggering token.

Fixed an issue with Play Sound so that it will respect who it's supposed to play for.

Fixed an issue with Play Sound that the label wasn't using localization.

Added toggle option to the Change Door State.  If the door is locked it will not toggle, but if open or closed it will toggle between the two.

Added the option to notification to set who it should be shown to.

Fixed an issue with notification so that handle bar replacements are done properly.

Fixed an issue with notification so that the label is created properly.

Fixed an issue with Chat Message so that it gets the speaker properly.

Fixed an issue with Chat Message so that handle bar replacements are done properly.

Added option for flavor text to the Chat Message.

Added option for roll mode to Roll Table.

Fixed issue that prevented Reset Fog action from working.

Fixed issue of who the journal is displayed to.  Previously it was just showing to the GM, now you can have it show to everyone, players, or the triggering token.

Added the "Add Item" action.  So when the Tile is triggered it will add the specific item to the token's inventory.

Fixed issue with teleporting preloading a scene.

BREAKING CHANGES!!!

I've updated how I pass tiles and tokens to functions, this will break Monk's TokenBar.  It's fixed, but TokenBar will need to be released and updated for it to work.

## Version 1.0.18

Added option to choose all Tokens currently within the Tile, to go along with "Current Tile", "Triggering Token", and "Player Tokens"

Added option to teleport to a Tile instead of an x/y location.  This way you can move to destination of the teleport easier.

Added additional trigger modes, On Movement, On Enter/Exit, and On Click.  Movement will trigger if the Token moves at all within the Tile (this includes entering and exiting the Tile).  On Enter/Exit will fire on both entering and exiting (be aware this can cause the Tile to trigger twice if the Token moves across it).  And On Click makes it so the Tile will not trigger at all unless you manually click it.

Added option to trigger based on who is controlling the token.  Currently it's restricted to the type of token, but if a GM moves a player token, you might not want the Tile to trigger.  The text has been changed to make it a little clearer what's meant by each setting.

Removed the option to add an animation when teleporting.  It was a bit silly and can be replaced using actual animations via a macro.

Teleport will flash an overlay over the screen when teleporting begins to make the transition a little less jarring, and will pan the canvas so that the token is in approximately the same spot it was relative to the screen.  The overlay and canvas pan only affect the player.

The GM will now receive a notification if a token has teleported to a different scene.

If the teleport is to a different scene it will detect a scene shift and begin preloading it.

Alter will now check the actor of a token to see if it can apply the changes there if it can't find the attribute on the token itself.  If the property being referenced is an object it will try and use the .value property.  The value part now supports handlebar substitutions.

Notification, and Chat Message now support handlebar substitutions.  actor, tile, token, and user can be used for related property names.

Active Effects should now be supported on PF2E

Fixed issues with playing an animated Tile wasn't being shown to players.

Executing a macro has hopefully gone through it's last change in awhile, sorry for changing the arguments around all the time.  I think I've settled on the proper order now.  Unfortunately due to the way Active Tiles is called I need to include the token, tile, and actor information within the arguments.  So the actual arguments passed from Active Tiles will be included in an args property.  This is a little weird as you now have to reference it using args[0].args[0] for the first property.  The data added to the args field will be split on spaces, but strings can be quote delimited.  And it will also support handlebar substitution.

Overridden functions are now using libWrapper

## Version 1.0.17
