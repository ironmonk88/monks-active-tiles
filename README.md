# Monk's Active Tile Triggers
Add-On Module for Foundry VTT
Want to teleport, or open doors, or hide characters, or display a message, or play a sound, or change a token's elevation when a token walks over a tile... now you can

## Installation
Simply use the install module screen within the FoundryVTT setup

## Usage & Current Features
When a Tile is drawn on the scene, another tab will be added, called triggers.

You can set the triggering to be active or not.  If the tile is inactive, then nothing happens when a token walks over it.
Triggering of the tile can also be set to be triggered by everyone, or restricted to GM only tokens, or player only tokens.
You can specify the chance that a tile will be triggered, so if the trap only has a 50% of working at any given time this is an option.
